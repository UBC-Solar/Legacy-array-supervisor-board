/**
 * This file "declares" the registers used in the module.
 * Due to how the module is set up with the intent to be 
 * part of an embedded application, this header file must 
 * be included and must consist of the register macros.
 * However, the tests run locally and we cannot determine 
 * which memory location will be free at compile time. 
 * As a result, global variables are used in place of 
 * register macros. 
 *
 * Since hardware mocks are required for this test suite, 
 * and the hardware mock will use the same struct and register
 * definitions the global register pointers are declared (marked 
 * as extern,) not defined, to prevent collisions during the 
 * linking stage. This also means that the register pointers will 
 * have to be defined in the unit test file.
